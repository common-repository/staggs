=== PRODUCT CONFIGURATOR FOR WOOCOMMERCE ===

If you have WooCommerce installed, you can create any configurator you like based on WooCommerce Simple products. Simply check the box 'Enable Staggs Product Configurator' and you can start building your configurator using the attributes and template.

With WooCommerce installed, you can use the WooCommerce checkout system to let the customer directly pay at checkout.

=== PRODUCT CONFIGURATOR FOR WORDPRESS ===

You can use the Staggs product configurator in WordPress too! WooCommerce is not required. In WordPress, you can build any configurator you like.

We have created our own build-in product type for WordPress that you can use to create product configurators.

[Learn how you can build a product configurator in WordPress](https://staggs.app/docs/create-product-configurator-wordpress/)

Note: there is no checkout system, so you can only create product configurators on a request quote basis using forms. You can also let customers directly send emails with the configured values.

=== PRODUCT ADD-ONS FOR WOOCOMMERCE ===

With Staggs you don't have to create full-fledged product configurators. You can also extend your simple product forms with additional product options.

=== SHORTCODE SUPPORT FOR PAGE BUILDERS AND BLOCK THEMES ===

If you are using a page builder, you can use the following shortcodes to output the configurator on product pages:

* `[staggs_configurator]` to display complete configurator code;
* `[staggs_configurator_popup_button]` to display the popup trigger button (the popup is not visible by default).

You can also choose to 'design' your own template, using each of the following shortcodes:

* `[staggs_configurator_gallery]` to display configurator image gallery;
* `[staggs_configurator_form]` to display the form containing all option groups and values;
* `[staggs_configurator_totals]` to display the add to cart or request invoice button;

[Learn how to display the product configurator in page builders](https://staggs.app/docs/page-builders-display-product-configurator/)

Note: you can also use shortcodes on regular posts and pages, but you have to pass the product id as a parameter to the shortcode, like this: `[staggs_configurator product_id="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID_HERE"]`

=== ITâ€™S FAST AND EASY TO USE ===

Getting started with the Staggs product configurator is simple and straight forward:

1. Create your configurable attributes
2. Create a configurator template to define the template and layout settings
3. Build the configurable products with the Staggs attributes

We have optimized the product configurator for performance and speed, so you can expect your configurators to load just as fast as your regular product pages!

=== RESPONSIVE DESIGN ===

The Staggs product configurator templates are fully responsive and are embedded directly onto the page.

You can build your configurator right from your WordPress dashboard and the configurator loads directly on the page. No need for embedded iframes.

=== IMPROVED PRODUCT VISUALIZATION ===

The Staggs product configurator can help you visualize changes in the product in multiple ways. You can add regular images that stack upon each other, display the image from multiple angles using multiple gallery images, use 3D rendered images of a product, or maximize the visualizations by creating a 3D configurator with AR support!

=== STACKABLE IMAGES ===

Save countless hours creating and uploading images for all of your product variations. Simply use our layered image preview that stacks all the images on top of each other. You even have control over where the image should go: always on top, at the bottom or maybe on layer four. You are in full control of how the product preview is going to look!

=== SUPPORT FOR 3D CONFIGURATORS & AR MODE ===

The Staggs product configurator comes with a lot of different visualization options. One of the PRO features is the support for 3D models and AR views. 

If you are looking for ways to take your product visualizations to the next level, you can create a 3D product configurator in WooCommerce with Staggs!

=== WORKS WELL WITH OTHER PLUGINS ===

We have added support for various other WordPress plugins, and we will keep expanding the list. Plugins we support at the moment of writing:

* Advanced Custom Fields PRO: Supercharge your Staggs admin panel with ACF PRO fields
* Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, WP Forms, Ninja Forms and Fluent Forms: link configurator to a form to request quotes

=== BUILT-IN ANALYTICS MODULE ===

Note: this feature is not available for WordPress-only installations.

=== A RELIABLE GROWING PLATFORM ===

== Installation ==

= Installation from within WordPress =

1. Visit **Plugins > Add New**.
2. Search for **Staggs**.
3. Install and activate the Staggs product configurator plugin.

= Manual installation =

1. Upload `staggs.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the 'Staggs' tab in the admin menu
4. Create configurator attributes
5. Create a new WooCommerce Simple product and check the box 'Enable configurator' in the product general tab.
7. Add your attributes in the product configurator builder.
8. Create a new configurator temmplate in Staggs -> Templates and link the template to the configurator.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Why does my configurator not show up? =

A. If you are using Elementor or a block based theme, like the new 2024 theme, you need to use [shortcodes](https://staggs.app/docs/using-shortcodes/) to display the configurator. In classic themes like Astra or Storefront, the configurator will show up by default.

= Q. Why does my configurator builder not show up on the product page? =

A. Make sure your product type is set to "Simple" and you have checked the box "Enable Staggs Product Configurator" in the Product data section. If the box is still not visible, please check your Screen settings in the top right-hand corner.

= Q. Why does the WooCommerce Cart Block show default product image? =

A. The WooCommerce Cart block does not allow content overrides by third-party plugins, so the images can't be replaced. Please use the WooCommerce Cart shortcode [woocommerce_cart] if you want the configuration images visible.

= Q. My attribute pages are loading slow. What can I do?  =

A. If you have loads of attribute options, the pages of Staggs tend to load slower. At this point you might want to consider migrating to [ACF PRO fields](https://staggs.app/staggs-and-acf-pro/). These fields load faster and are better optimized.

= Q. My images are not showing up correctly. What should I do? =

A. It is most likely you have not defined a fixed image layer order. Simply go over to your Staggs attributes and locate the field "Image Layer Order" in the Presentation tab. There you can enter a numeric value. Higher numbers will be displayed on top.

= Q. Does the plugin require WooCommerce? =

A. No, this plugin does not require WooCommerce. However, you will need WooCommerce if you want to receive payments. Our plugin uses the WooCommerce cart system for a convenient and familiar checkout process.

= Q. Does it support variable products? =

A. No, we only support WooCommerce Simple Products. WooCommerce Variable Products are a kind of configurable product already.

= Q. Can I use this plugin as a product designer tool? =

A. The plugin is intented to be used as a product configurator tool. It allows you to add text and images onto your products. But this plugin has no drag and drop features, nor the supported quality to use for print on demand.

= Q. My question is not listed =

A. If you have any questions about the plugin, kindly send an email to contact@staggs.app.
